This is the HTML code using Leaflet that creates for the "Alumni Map" for the Castillo Lab website.

Some notes on what is happening:

To add a variable or new alumni:
1. Scroll down to the list of variables creating markers for alumni members
2. Copy and paste a marker from the corresponding group
3. Label it a new marker name (if the last was 23, make the new one 24) so that there are no repeating variable names
4. Update the coordinate, name, organization, job title, and website information if relevant
5. Double check it looks the eay you want, save and push to main

Variables labeled "Marker_#Letter" = PostDocs
Variables labeled "MarkerLetter" = graduate students
Variables labeled "Marker#" = undergraduate students

Circle size, color and style, background map, and the legend can all be changed.

I would suggest just asking ChatGPT, looking up leaflet turoials, or feel free to reach out to Max Buglisi for questions on more involved alterations.
